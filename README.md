- Hi i am Sheratish. I've been working as a product manager for past 3 years. 
- I don't have much exposure to progrqamming languages but my interest towards data science is making me lean towards Python & R. I am learning about Data Science.
- This is my first crack at Github to start my journey to learn about Data Science and grow in that direction.
- I will be more than happy to get guidance from this community and enhance my skillsets in Data Science.
